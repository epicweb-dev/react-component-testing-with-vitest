# Element presence

So far we've covered finding and interacting with elements that are present or will appear on the page. But how do we test for elements that should _not_ render?

This is where you would normally reach for an [inverse assertion](https://www.epicweb.dev/inverse-assertions) to get a predictable result and guard yourself from false-positive tests:

```ts
const notificationVisiblePromise = vi.waitFor(() => {
	expect(notification).toBeVisible()
})

// Instead of asserting that the element is not visible,
// which may lead to false-positive results if it appears after a delay,
// check that the element has never appeared instead.
await expect(notificationVisiblePromise).rejects.toThrow()
```

Or, alternatively, use the designated `waitForElementToBeRemoved()` utility from React Testing Library:

```ts
await waitForElementToBeRemoved(notification)
```

**However, there's a more convenient way to do this in Vitest!**

üë®‚Äçüíº In this exercise, you will use the retry-ability of Vitest's `expect.element()` function to assert that the discount code has been removed from the UI once you click the respective button. Go to the <InlineFile file="./src/discount-code-form.browser.test.tsx">`discount-code-form.browser.test.tsx`</InlineFile> test suite and follow the instructions to complete the new test case.
