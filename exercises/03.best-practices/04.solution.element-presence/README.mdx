# Element presence

Let's prepare our `<DiscountCodeForm />` for this test case by doing the following:

```tsx filename=discount-code-form.test.browser.tsx nonumber highlight=5-6,9-12,15-16
test('removes the applied discount code', async () => {
	render(<DiscountCodeForm />)

	// Enter a discount code.
	const discountInput = page.getByLabelText('Discount code')
	await discountInput.fill('EPIC2025')

	// Apply the code.
	const applyDiscountButton = page.getByRole('button', {
		name: 'Apply discount',
	})
	await applyDiscountButton.click()

	// Make sure that it's actually applied.
	const discountText = page.getByText('Discount: EPIC2025 (-20%)')
	await expect.element(discountText).toBeVisible()
})
```

All that remains now is to remove this discount code the way a user would. For that, I will first locate the "Remove discount" button by its role `button` and its accessible text:

```tsx filename=discount-code-form.test.browser.tsx nonumber
const removeDiscountButton = page.getByRole('button', {
	name: 'Remove discount',
})
await removeDiscountButton.click()
```

And now I will write a regular assertion with `expect.element()` using the `.not.toBeInTheDocument()` as the matcher:

```tsx filename=discount-code-form.test.browser.tsx nonumber highlight=1
await expect.element(discountText).not.toBeInTheDocument()
```

So how does this work?

It's due to the retry mechanism built-in into `expect.element()`, which automatically makes Vitest `waitFor` the given assertion. Even if it takes time to remove the `discountText` element from the page, our test will wait until that happens and throw if it doesn't.

> await expect.element(locator, { interval, timeout })
