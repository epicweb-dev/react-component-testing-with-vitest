# Installation and setup

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/react-component-testing-with-vitest/vitest-browser-mode/installation-and-setup" />

It's time to take the first step forward Vitest Browser Mode! In this one, you and I are going to install all the necessary dependencies so we can start testing our components in the actual browser.

## Install dependencies

As the first order of business, I'm going to uninstall the packages I won't be needing anymore:

```sh nonumber
npm uninstall jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

> ðŸ¦‰ I am uninstalling React Testing Library because I won't be using it directly for my in-browser tests. **That doesn't mean its API and practices are gone!** Instead, I will continue using them through the Vitest and Playwright APIs that are inspired by RTL and promote its best practices.

Now I can install the dependencies required for the Browser Mode in Vitest:

```sh nonumber
npm i -D @vitest/browser vitest-browser-react
```

Let's break down what these packages do:

- [`@vitest/browser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitest/browser) enables the browser mode and provides the bindings to interact with the underlying browser;
- [`vitest-browser-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitest-browser-react) provisions rendering of React components (similar to `@testing-library/react`);

The installation step is done, and now it's time to configure Vitest is it can run my component tests in the actual browser.

## Configure Vitest

To enable the Browser Mode in Vitest, I need to set `test.browser.enabled` to `true` in my `vite.config.ts`/`vitest.config.ts`:

```ts filename=vite.config.ts remove=10 add=11-13
/// <reference types="vitest" />
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
	test: {
		globals: true,
		environment: 'jsdom',
		browser: {
			enabled: true,
		},
	},
})
```

As the next step, I need to tell Vitest what browsers I want for testing my components. Let's use Chromium by setting the `test.browser.instances` correctly:

```ts filename=vite.config.ts add=11-15
/// <reference types="vitest" />
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
	test: {
		browser: {
			enabled: true,
			instances: [
				{
					browser: 'chromium',
				},
			],
		},
	},
})
```

> ðŸ¦‰ You can configure _multiple browser instances_ to execute your component tests. This is handy for solid cross-browser code coverage. You will learn how to use browser providers later in this workshop.

## Configure TypeScript

The last thing that remains is to extend the TypeScript configuration to recognize DOM-specific matches, like `expect().toBeVisible()` as they come built-in in Vitest.

First, I will remove the `import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest'` import we previously had in the test:

```tsx filename=file-preview.test.tsx remove=1
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest'
```

And replace it with a type reference to Vitest's browser matchers in `tsconfig.test.json`:

```json filename=tsconfig.test.json add=9
{
	"extends": "./tsconfig.app.json",
	"include": ["src/**/*", "src/**/*.test.ts*"],
	"exclude": [],
	"compilerOptions": {
		"types": [
			"vitest/globals",
			// ðŸ‘‡
			"@vitest/browser/matchers"
		]
	}
}
```

And with that, the installation step is done!
