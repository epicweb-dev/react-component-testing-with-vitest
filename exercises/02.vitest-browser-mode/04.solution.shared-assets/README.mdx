# Shared assets

There are two types of test setup you can have: _global_ and _local_. The global setup applies to all tests, while the local one can be introduced on a test suite or a test case basis. I would like to include some shared assets, like styles, to apply to _all_ component tests, which means I need a global setup.

I will start by creating a `vitest.browser.setup.ts` file. The naming here doesn't matter that much, but I like to keep Vitest-related files starting with `vitest.*`.

In that file, I will import the assets I want to include when rendering any component:

```ts filename=vitest.browser.setup.ts add=1
import './src/index.css'
```

To make Vite process this file the same way it does the rest of my application, I need to include a type reference to `vite-env.d.ts`:

```ts filename=vitest.browser.setup.ts add=1
/// <reference path="./src/vite-env.d.ts" />
import './src/index.css'
```

Now all that remains is to tell Vitest to use this file as the global setup for the Browser Mode.

In `vite.config.ts`, I will provide the path to this setup file as the value for the `setupFiles` property on the current browser instance:

```ts filename=vite.config.ts add=15
/// <reference types="vitest" />
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [react()],
	test: {
		globals: true,
		browser: {
			enabled: true,
			provider: 'playwright',
			instances: [
				{
					browser: 'chromium',
					setupFiles: ['./vitest.browser.setup.ts'],
				},
			],
		},
	},
})
```

If I run my tests now, I will see that the styles are applied to the rendered component correctly! :tada:
