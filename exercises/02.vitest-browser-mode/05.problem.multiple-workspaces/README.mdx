# Multiple workspaces

Our current Vitest configuration runs _all tests_ in Browser Mode. This isn't ideal when you need to run different types of tests in the same project - like unit and integration tests running in a Node.js environment alongside browser-based component tests.

You can fix this by introducing _different workspaces_ for different types of tests. In fact, I think this is just the right task for you...

👨‍💼 In this one, you will expand the Vitest configuration to support running multiple types of tests in the same project. This will be a multi-step process to make sure you have Vitest and TypeScript configured correctly for your tests.

🐨 First, update <InlineFile file="vite.config.ts">`vite.config.ts`</InlineFile> to list multiple [workspaces](https://main.vitest.dev/guide/workspace.html#configuration). Define one for unit tests and another for component tests.

🐨 Next, rename <InlineFile file="tsconfig.test.json">`tsconfig.test.json`</InlineFile> to `tsconfig.test.browser.json`. This TypeScript configuration will only apply to the component tests now. Update its `include` setting to target `**/*.browser.test.ts*` files:

```json filename=tsconfig.test.browser.json remove=2 add=3
{
	"include": ["**/*.test.ts"],
	"include": ["**/*.browser.test.ts*"]
}
```

🐨 To have proper type-checking in unit tests, create a new <InlineFile file="tsconfig.test.unit.json">`tsconfig.test.unit.json`</InlineFile> file and add the necessary properties for unit tests. You can use this as an example:

```json filename=tsconfig.test.unit.json
{
	"extends": "./tsconfig.base.json",
	"include": ["**/*.test.ts*"],
	"exclude": ["**/*.browser.test.ts*"],
	"compilerOptions": {
		"target": "esnext",
		"module": "preserve",
		"types": ["node", "vitest/globals"]
	}
}
```

🐨 You might've noticed that this config relies on `@types/node` to expose Node.js type in unit tests, but that dependency is missing! Install `@types/node` as a dev dependency to fix that.

🐨 For TypeScript to pick up all of these configs, update <InlineFile file="tsconfig.json">`tsconfig.json`</InlineFile> to include the newly added configurations in `references`:

```json filename=tsconfig.json remove=6 add=7-8
{
	"files": [],
	"references": [
		{ "path": "./tsconfig.app.json" },
		{ "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" },
		{ "path": "./tsconfig.test.json" },
		{ "path": "./tsconfig.test.unit.json" },
		{ "path": "./tsconfig.test.browser.json" }
	]
}
```

🐨 Finally, rename the existing `file-preview.test.tsx` component test to `file-preview.browser.test.tsx` to be included in the correct Vitest workspace.

See you on the other side once you're done to go through each step in more detail.
