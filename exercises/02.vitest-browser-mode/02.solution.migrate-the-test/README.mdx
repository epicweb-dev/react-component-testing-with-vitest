# Migrate the test

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/react-component-testing-with-vitest/vitest-browser-mode/migrate-the-test/solution" />

While component tests in Vitest Browser Mode are extremely similar to those you used to write in JSDOM, there are a couple of key differences around component rendering, selecting elements on the page, and writing assertions.

## Rendering

First, I will adjust the rendering part. Before, I was using the `render()` function from `@testing-library/react`, which now gets replaced with the same function from the `vitest-browser-react` package:

```tsx filename=file-preview.test.tsx remove=1 add=2
import { render } from '@testing-library/react'
import { render } from 'vitest-browser-react'
```

Much like React Testing Library, Vitest provides different bindings for rendering components from different frameworks, like `vitest-browser-react`, `vitest-browser-vue`, or `vitest-browser-svelte`.

Usage-wise, both `render()` functions are identical, where Vitest's version supports a subset of the render `options` compared to RTL. This means that the render call itself stays the same:

```tsx filename=file-preview.test.tsx highlight=5
import { render } from 'vitest-browser-react'
import { FilePreview } from './file-preview.tsx'

test('displays the preview card', () => {
  render(<FilePreview file={...} />)
})
```

> ðŸ¦‰ Unlike React Testing Library, `vitest-browser-react` performs the render cleanup **before** rendering the component. This allows you to observe its state on the page in case the test fails.

## Element locators

Previously, I used the `screen` object from RTL to find elements in the virtual DOM. When using Vitest Browser Mode, I can now locate elements (and interact with them) using the `page` object from `@vitest/browser/context` instead:

```tsx filename=file-preview.test.tsx add=1 highlight=8-9
import { page } from '@vitest/browser/context'
import { render } from 'vitest-browser-react'
import { FilePreview } from './file-preview.tsx'

test('displays the preview card', () => {
  render(<FilePreview file={...} />)

  // Find an element with the text content of "file.txt".
  page.getByText('file.txt')
})
```

If you find this similar to Playwright, well, it's because the `page` API in Vitest is directly inspired by Playwright's `page`! It doesn't provide you with all the page's properties and methods because you aren't in a full end-to-end context to take advantage of them anyway.

With the adoption of the `page` API, Vitest introduces the concept of [_locators_](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators) into your test.

> ðŸ¦‰ There's no `findBy*` and `queryBy*` methods in Vitest Browser Mode. All selectors are `getBy*` that now resolves to locators instead of concrete HTML elements. Think of it as a promise to an element instead of its immediate reference.

This means that `page.getByText('file.txt')` gives you a _locator_ to find that element when you need to. For example, you can access the exact HTML element by calling the `.element()` method on the locator:

```tsx
// Get a single element for the locator.
const text = page.getByText('hello world') // Locator
text.element() // HTMLElement

// Get all the elements for the locator (i.e. `getAllBy*`).
const buttons = page.getByRole('button') // Locator
text.elements() // [HTMLElement]
```

That being said, you don't normally deal with HTML elements directly. Instead, you rely on built-in interactions and assertions that Vitest provides.

## Element assertions

With React Testing Library, our element assertions looked like this:

```tsx filename=file-preview.test.tsx nonumber
expect(screen.getByText('file.txt')).toBeVisible()
expect(screen.getByText('hello world')).toBeVisible()
```

Since `screen` has been replaced by `page` from Vitest, we need to adjust them.

```tsx filename=file-preview.test.tsx nonumber remove=1,4 add=2,5
expect(screen.getByText('file.txt')).toBeVisible()
expect(page.getByText('file.txt')).toBeVisible()

expect(screen.getByText('hello world')).toBeVisible()
expect(page.getByText('hello world')).toBeVisible()
```

There's one more thing we can do to make these assertions rock-solid. If we use `await expect.element()` instead of plain `expect()`, we can rely on Vitest's built-in retry mechanism when resolving the given locators;

```tsx filename=file-preview.test.tsx nonumber
await expect.element(page.getByText('file.txt')).toBeVisible()
//           ^^^^^^^
await expect.element(page.getByText('hello world')).toBeVisible()
//           ^^^^^^^
```

This reads as "_I eventually expect an element with text 'hello world' to be visible on the page_", which is exactly the case!

> ðŸ¦‰ `expect.element()` is a shorthand for `expect.poll(() => element)`, which retries any given assertion until it passes within a fixed time window (similar to `waitFor()` or `findBy*`). Since it's an eventual result, this method returns a promise that you have to await.

## Running tests

Now that I've updated the test suite, I can see it passing once I run `npm test`:

```txt nonumber nocopy
 chromium  Browser runner started at http://localhost:63315/

 âœ“  chromium  src/file-preview.test.tsx (1 test) 60ms
   âœ“ displays the preview card
```

:tada:

But there's still a couple of things we can improve in the setup. Let's explore those in the following exercises.
