# Multiple workspaces

Real-world projects often combine multiple types of tests at the same time. Vitest is a great choice for both unit and integration tests, but those two have quite different requirements and, as a result, may need different setups.

Vitest solves this by using _workspaces_.

## Vitest Workspaces

A [workspace](https://main.vitest.dev/guide/workspace.html) allows you to describe multiple configurations independently. Think of it as a package workspace, where a single repo can host multiple different packages. In the same way, a single Vitest process can run multiple different test projects.

Workspaces are listed in the `test.workspace` property in your Vitest config, and can include paths to nested packages or Vitest config files or inline configuration.

I will define two workspaces:

```ts filename=vite.config.ts add=11-17,20-35
/// <reference types="vitest" />
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { configDefaults } from 'vitest/config'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [react()],
	test: {
		workspace: [
			{
				test: {
					name: 'unit',
					globals: true,
					include: ['**/*.test.ts'],
					exclude: [...configDefaults.exclude, '**/*.browser.test.ts(x)?'],
					environment: 'node',
				},
			},
			{
				extends: true,
				test: {
					name: 'browser',
					globals: true,
					include: ['**/*.browser.test.ts(x)?'],
					browser: {
						enabled: true,
						provider: 'playwright',
						instances: [
							{
								browser: 'chromium',
								setupFiles: ['./vitest.browser.setup.ts'],
							},
						],
					},
				},
			},
		],
	},
})
```

Let's go over them in more detail.

The first workspace include the configuration for running unit tests:

```ts nonumber
{
  test: {
		name: 'unit',
		globals: true,
		include: ['**/*.test.ts'],
		exclude: ['**/*.browser.test.ts(x)?'],
		environment: 'node',
  },
},
```

- `name` gives this workspace a name and allows me to run it in isolation anytime I want by providing the `--project=unit` option to the Vitest CLI;
- `include` lists the test file patterns to include in this run. In this case, I want for the unit tests to cover test files ending with `*.test.ts`;
- `exclude` does the opposite of `include`, listing the file patterns to _ignore_. Since my browser tests also end with `*.test.ts`, I need to exclude them not to be confused with unit tests;
- `environment` controls the test environment used for this workspace. I want my unit tests to run in Node.js, so I provide `'node'` as the enivornment here.

> :owl: Notice that each workspace lists Vitest configuration starting from the root by including the `test` key again. This is handy because each workspace can have a different set of Vite options and `plugins` for different test files.

Similarly, here's the workspace for the browser (component) tests:

```ts nonumber
{
	test: {
		name: 'browser',
		globals: true,
		include: ['**/*.browser.test.ts(x)?'],
		browser: {
			enabled: true,
			provider: 'playwright',
			instances: [
				{
					browser: 'chromium',
					setupFiles: ['./vitest.browser.setup.ts'],
				},
			],
		},
	},
},
```

Here, I'm naming this workspace `'browser'` and configuring it to include only `*.browser.test.ts(x)` test files. These will be my component tests. For the rest of the configuration, I simply moved the existing `test.browser` configuration under this workspace and left it as-is.

## TypeScript

The next step is to deal with TypeScript. One of the most overlooked aspects of using TypeScript is that you often need _multiple configurations_ within the same project. Your source code, unit tests, integration tests, and test utilities are all written in TypeScript but have different concerns that may require different types.

> :scroll: If you want to dive deeper into the reason behing using multiple TypeScript configurations and how to do that properly, read my post called [One Thing Nobody Explained To You About TypeScript](https://kettanaito.com/blog/one-thing-nobody-explained-to-you-about-typescript).

In our project, unit and component tests have a different set of type requirements because they run in different environments. This means I need to introduce two separate configurations to address these differences: `tsconfig.test.unit.json` and `tsconfig.test.browser.json`.

Let's start with the unit tests:

```json filename=tsconfig.test.unit.json
{
	"extends": "./tsconfig.base.json",
	"include": ["**/*.test.ts*"],
	"exclude": ["**/*.browser.test.ts*"],
	"compilerOptions": {
		"target": "esnext",
		"module": "preserve",
		"types": ["node", "vitest/globals"]
	}
}
```

Similar to how I've configured Vitest workspaces to apply only to specific file patterns, I tell TypeScript to apply this configuration only to the `*.test.ts` files, excluding the browser tests at `*.browser.test.ts*`. The most important bit here is the `compilerOptions.types` property:

```json filename=tsconfig.test.unit.json nonumber
"types": ["node", "vitest/globals"]
```

This includes Node.js type definitions (`@types/node`) and Vitest global types (e.g. `test` and `expect`) for my unit tests. Since I don't have the Node.js types installed, I need to add them as a dependency to the project:

```sh nonumber
npm i -D @types/node
```

Next, I rename the existing `tsconfig.test.json` to `tsconfig.test.browser.json` to act as the TypeScript configuration for my browser component tests:

```json highlight=3,7
{
	"extends": "./tsconfig.base.json",
	"include": ["**/*.browser.test.ts*"],
	"compilerOptions": {
		"target": "esnext",
		"module": "preserve",
		"types": ["vitest/globals", "@vitest/browser/providers/playwright"]
	}
}
```

## Test commands

To make it easier to run specific types of tests, I will modify `package.json` to add `test:unit` and `test:integration` commands:

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"test": "vitest",
		"test:unit": "vitest --project=unit",
		"test:integration": "vitest --project=browser"
	}
}
```

## Test files grouping

There are multiple ways to group different types of tests in the same project:

- **By file name**. This is the one I'm using this exercise, adopting `*.test.ts` for unit tests and `*.browser.test.tsx` for integration tests;
- **By directory name**. For example, you can keep unit tests in `./src` while integration tests in `./tests`

The choice is up to you â€” I only recommend you stick to one approach and don't mix them in your app.
