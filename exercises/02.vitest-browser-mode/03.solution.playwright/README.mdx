# Playwright

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/react-component-testing-with-vitest/vitest-browser-mode/playwright/solution" />

Let's start by installing `playwright`:

```sh nonumber
npm i -D playwright
```

Playwright needs browser executables to be present on your machine to run. In this workshop, I am using Chromium as my browser of choice, so I can install just that particular browser by running the following command:

```sh nonumber
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

> ðŸ¦‰ You can provide the Playwright CLI with a specific browser you want to be installed. This reduces its footprint in the system by fetching only the browsers you need.

The next step is to tell Vitest to use Playwright as the browser provider for component tests. In `vite.config.ts`, set the `test.browser.provider` option to `'playwright'`:

```ts filename=vite.config.ts add=12
/// <reference types="vitest" />
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
	test: {
		globals: true,
		browser: {
			enabled: true,
			provider: 'playwright',
			instances: [
				{
					browser: 'chromium',
				},
			],
		},
	},
})
```

And, finally, let's update the type definitions for the assertion matchers to be those from Playwright in `tsconfig.test.json`:

```json filename=tsconfig.test.json remove=9 add=10
{
	"extends": "./tsconfig.base.json",
	"include": ["**/*.test.ts*"],
	"compilerOptions": {
		"target": "esnext",
		"module": "preserve",
		"types": [
			"vitest/globals",
			"@vitest/browser/matchers",
			"@vitest/browser/providers/playwright"
		]
	}
}
```

This will make sure that the locators, user events, and matchers are correctly typed.
