# Break JSDOM

Before we talk about in-browser component testing, let's start with something familiar.

In this exercise, you have a simple React application that previews the files you upload from your computer. To do that, it has a `type="file"` input and reads the content of the chosen file to display it for the user.

You can run and play around with the application using this command:

```sh nonumber
npm run dev
```

Of course, like any quality software, this file preview app could use some automated tests. A great way to approach this is by introducing a test for the `<FilePreview />` component.

👨‍💼 This is where you come in. Follow the instructions in `file-preview.test.tsx` and complete the first automated test for this component. Try running it via `npm test` but don't be discouraged if it suddenly _fails_.
