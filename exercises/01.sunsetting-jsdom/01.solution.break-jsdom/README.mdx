# Break JSDOM

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/react-component-testing-with-vitest/sunsetting-jsdom/break-jsdom-exercise/solution" />

I start with rendering the `<FilePreview />` component in my test:

```tsx add=1,5
import { test, expect } from 'vitest'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { FilePreview } from './file-review.js'

test('displays the preview card', () => {
	render(<FilePreview file={new File(['hello world'], 'file.txt')} />)
})
```

I am using the `render()` function from React Testing Library as usual. Since my component requires the `file` prop, I am creating a dummy file instance using the [`File` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/File) and providing it as the input to my component.

This test case doesn't involve any interaction with the component so I jump straight to the assertion step.

Here, two things have my interest:

1. The component must render the name of the previewed file (i.e. `file.txt`);
1. The component must render the content of the previewed file.

I reflect those two expectations like so:

```tsx nonumber nocopy
expect(screen.getByText('file.txt')).toBeVisible()
expect(screen.getByText('hello world')).toBeVisible()
```

Looks like the first test is done. All that's left is to run via `npm test` and... Oh, no.

```sh nonumber nocopy
 FAIL  src/file-preview.test.tsx > displays the preview card
TypeError: file.text is not a function
 ❯ src/file-preview.tsx:7:8
      5|
      6|  useEffect(() => {
      7|   file.text().then(setPreviewText)
       |        ^
      8|  }, [file])
```

😱 Something must be terribly wrong here...

Except it's not. The `<FilePreview />` component calls the [`Blob.prototype.text`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/text) (`File` inherits from `Blob`) method to retrieve the file's content correctly. The test is also exceptionally short to have any hidden pitfalls. **All except for one**.

Turns out, the `Blob.prototype.text` method isn't implemented in JSDOM. You can reproduce this in isolation as well by running this code:

```ts nonumber
import { JSDOM } from 'jsdom'

const dom = new JSDOM()
const blob = new dom.window.Blob(['hello world'])
await blob.text()
// TypeError: (intermediate value).text is not a function
```

This is just one of the examples how introducing a custom, browser-like environment hurts your trust to your automated tests and the value you get from them. I really cannot stress this enough: _a valid test for a valid JavaScript code results in an error_. This test will run in Node.js as it will run in the browser, but not in JSDOM.
