# Extras

Hi :wave: Artem from the future here.

There's been a couple of changes to some of the technologies we went through in this workshop so I decided to add this extra exercise block to help you accommodate and understand those changes. Don't worry, **everything you've learned thus far still applies**. In my workshops, you're always getting concepts, mental models, and best practices first, APIs second.

But those APIs still matter and these extras are here to guide you through any changes that has happened to the tools you've been using.

<callout-info>The extra exercises _do not have any videos_, which does not diminish their practical value in any way.</callout-info>
