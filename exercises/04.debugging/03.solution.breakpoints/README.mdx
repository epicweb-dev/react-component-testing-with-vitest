## Replacing `debugger` with breakpoints

I will start the first task by removing all of the `debugger` statements from `tic-tac-toe.browser.test.tsx`:

```tsx filename=tic-tac-toe.browser.test.tsx remove=9,12,15
import { page } from '@vitest/browser/context'
import { render } from 'vitest-browser-react'
import { TicTacToe } from './tic-tac-toe.js'

test('places cross marks in a horizontal line', async () => {
	render(<TicTacToe />)

	await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'left middle' }).click()
	debugger

	await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'middle', exact: true }).click()
	debugger

	await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'right middle' }).click()
	debugger

	const squares = page.getByRole('button').elements().slice(3, 6)
	expect(squares.map((element) => element.textContent)).toEqual(['‚úó', '‚úó', '‚úó'])
})
```

Because I still want to be able to debug those steps, I will add _breakpoints_ to replace those `debugger`s using my IDE:

> ü¶â You can use both your IDE and the "Source" panel in your browser to add breakpoints, even if your code is already running. That will keep your source code clean and give you more power and flexibility compared to `debugger`.

## Conditional breakpoints

Speaking of more powers, it's time to put them to good use! But not before I finish the new test case for the `<MainMenu />` component.

As the name suggests, the menu component renders the main navigation for our application. To do that, it recursively iterates over the `menuItems` array to render those items and their possible children. This is, effectively, a loop with a base case and a recursive case:

```tsx filename=main-menu.tsx nonumber nocopy highlight=7,9
{
	props.items.map((item) => (
		<li key={item.url}>
			<NavLink to={item.url}>{item.title}</NavLink>
			{item.children ? (
				// Recursive case
				<MenuItemsList items={item.children} />
			) : // Base case.
			null}
		</li>
	))
}
```

But for some unknown reason, when I run the automated test, the link I expect to be active isn't the only one active!

```shell nonumber highlight=11-14
 ‚ùØ src/main-menu.browser.test.tsx:22:39
     20|  )!
     21|
     22|  await expect.element(currentPageLink).toHaveAccessibleName('Analytics')
       |                                       ^
     23| })
     24|

Caused by: Error: expect(element).toHaveAccessibleName()

Expected element to have accessible name:
  Analytics
Received:
  Dashboard
```

Something is definitely off here, and I can use breakpoints to help me find the root cause.

There's just a slight problem. Since the `<MainMenu />` component is recursive, if I put a breakpoint where I think is a good place to start debugging, it will trigger _for all rendered menu items_. That's not nice because I will be spending my time jumping between breakpoints instead of actually solving the issue.

This is where _conditional breakpoints_ can be a huge time-savior. They act just like the regulat breakpoints but they only trigger when their condition resolves to true. So I can say if `item.title === 'Dashboard'`, stop the execution. That's neat!

But not so fast. Conditional breakpoints can only access variables present in the _current scope_ (i.e. the scope where you are placing a breakpoint), and the `item` variable comes from the parental scope, which will make it impossible to use in the condition.

```tsx filename=main-menu.tsx nocopy nonumber highlight=12-13
function MenuItemsList({ items }: { items: Array<MenuItem> }) {
	return (
		<ul className="ml-4">
			{items.map((item) => {
				return (
					<li key={item.url}>
						<NavLink
							to={item.url}
							className={({ isActive }) =>
								[
									'px-2 py-1 hover:text-blue-600 hover:underline',
									// I'd like to put a conditional breakpoints somewhere here,
									// but the `item` variable isn't defined or referenced in this scope.
									isActive ? 'font-bold text-black' : 'text-gray-600',
								].join(' ')
							}
						>
							{item.title}
						</NavLink>
						{item.children ? <MenuItemsList items={item.children} /> : null}
					</li>
				)
			})}
		</ul>
	)
}
```

Luckily, I can fix this by referencing the `item` inside the `className` function's scope:

```tsx filename=main-menu.tsx nocopy remove=6 add=7-9
	<NavLink
		to={item.url}
		className={({ isActive }) =>
			[
				'px-2 py-1 hover:text-blue-600 hover:underline',
				isActive ? 'font-bold text-black' : 'text-gray-600',
				// Referencing the `item` variable in this closure will make it
				// possible to use for the conditional breakpoint.
				item && isActive ? 'font-bold text-black' : 'text-gray-600',
			].join(' ')
		}
	>
```

> This change won't affect the class name condition but instead will expose the `item` variable to this closure.

Now, I can add a conditional breakpoint in Visual Studio Code by right-clicking on the gutter next to the line I need and choosing the "Add Conditional Breakpoint..." option from the context menu:

![A screenshot of Visual Studio Code with the context menu open when right-clicked on the gutter. The "Add Conditional Breakpoint..." option is highlighted.](/assets/04-03-conditional-breakpoint-context-menu.png)

![A screenshot of Visual Studio Code with the Conditional breakpoint context menu open. The condition is entered to match the item with title "Dashboard".](/assets/04-03-conditional-breakpoint-add.png)

Let's run the `main-menu.browser.test.tsx` test suite with the debugger attached and arrive at this breakpoint just when I mean to:

![A screenshot of Visual Studio Code with the debugger stopped exactly at the conditional breakpoint](/assets/04-03-conditional-breakpoint-stop.png)

As usual, I can look around to see the `item` and `isActive` values in this scope. Just like I suspected, the `isActive` prop is set to `true` for the Dashboard menu item. But why?

The answer to that lies deeper down the stack trace. If I click on the `NavLinkWithRef` frame in the stack trace, the debugger will bring me to the rendering part of `NavLink` from my menu. Here, I can inspect all the props that the `NavLink` gets but also _gain access to everything in its scope_.

I am particularly interested in this line, where the `isActive` variable gets assigned:

```ts nonumber
let isActive =
	locationPathname === toPathname ||
	(!end &&
		locationPathname.startsWith(toPathname) &&
		locationPathname.charAt(endSlashPosition) === '/')
```

I can still see that it's `false`, but having access to all the data React Router uses to compute this value, I can play around with it and, hopefully, find the root cause.

I will start from inspecting the `locationPathname` and `toPathname` values in the Debug console:

![A screenshot of Visual Studio Code with the Debug console panel open. Inside, two variables are printed out. The first one is "locationPathname" with the value "/dashboard/analytics". The second one is "toPathname" with the value "/dashboard".](/assets/04-03-debug-console-nav-link.png)

<callout-success>Debug console is your go-to choice for evaluating expressions inside the breakpoints. You can reference everything available in the current scope, call functions, declare new variables, etc. This is your _debugging sandbox_!</callout-success>

Since `locationPathname` (document location) is `/dashboard/analytics` just like I set it in tests, it certainly doesn't equal the link's `to` path, which is `/dashboard`. The condition follows on, and now it branches based on the `end` prop. Once I take a peek at its value...

![A screenshot of Visual Studio Code with the Debug console panel open. Inside, the "end" variable is printed out, and its value is false.](/assets/04-03-debug-console-end.png)

It's `false`! This means that the first logical branch will resolve (the one with `!end`), and return `true` as the `isActive` value because _current location starts from the link's path_:

```ts nonumber
'/dashboard/analytics'.startsWith('/dashboard')
// true
```

ü§¶ I forgot to pass `end={true}` to the `NavLink` in my menu. Luckily, that's an easy fix:

```tsx filename=main-menu.tsx nonumber nocopy add=3
	<NavLink
		to={item.url}
		end={true}
		className={({ isActive }) =>
			[
				'px-2 py-1 hover:text-blue-600 hover:underline',
				isActive ? 'font-bold text-black' : 'text-gray-600',
			].join(' ')
		}
	>
```

> The `end` prop (also `exact` sometimes) forces the link to be active only if its path and the document path are identical.

With this change, the test suite is green again! üéâ

```sh nonumber
 ‚úì  chromium  src/main-menu.browser.test.tsx (1 test) 12ms
   ‚úì renders the currently active menu link

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  1 passed (1)
```

Now you know how to harness the power of conditional breakpoints to debug your React components or any JavaScript code in general. Use it wisely!
