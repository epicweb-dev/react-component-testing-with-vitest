# Debug console

Breakpoints allow you to stop your code's execution at any point in time. This is extremely handy to observe what's going on in your code or tests. But there's a way to get even more value out of them.

Sometimes simply looking at the state of your code may not be enough to understand the unexpected behavior. This is where being able to _evaluate_ things at a certain breakpoint can be a huge timesaver.

In this exercise, you will learn how to do just that, using the built-in "Debug console" in Visual Studio Code.

## Debug console

Debug console is a special kind of console that comes with modern IDEs. Its purpose is to give you an interface to access and run things during your debugging sessions.

Debug console behaves similarly to the browser's Console, giving you a sandbox to run expressions and see their result in real time. It's time you got your hands on it!

## Your task

üë®‚Äçüíº In this exercise, you will expand on the last debugging session (the one about `<MenuMenu />`) and actually verify that the `matchPath()` logic was to blame for the bug.

1. Start the tests in debug mode.
1. Put the conditional breakpoint right where it was the last time‚Äîon the `return` line of rendering each menu item in the `<MenuItemList />` component.
1. Once that's done and you have the test reach that breakpoint, open the "Debug console" (<kbd>Shift+Command+Y</kbd> in Visual Studio Code). _You can now interact with it!_.

> Debug console will open automatically when you start a new debugging session.

The console has access to all the variables at your breakpoint's scope. For example, try typing `item` and press Enter:

![A Visual Studio Code window with the debug console open. The value of the item variable is printed in the debug console to inspect.](/assets/04-04-debug-console-example.png)

This is the value of the `item` variable at this breakpoint!

> ü¶â The objects you log out in Debug console are **interactve**. Try expanding some of the `item` properties to see that for yourself.

With that in mind, run the `matchPath()` function in the Debug console with _exact values_, providing `/dashboard` as the path you want to check, leaving `location.pathname` reference as-is. Compare the printed result of matching the path with the `end: false` and `end: true` option set.
