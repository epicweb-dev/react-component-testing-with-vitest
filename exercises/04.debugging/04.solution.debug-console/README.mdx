# Debug console

First, I will try to run the `matchPath()` function with the same arguments as it's being run during the rendering by entering the whole expression in the Debug console:

```
matchPath({ path: '/dashboard', end: false }, location.pathname)
```

The console will print me the match object as the returned value from running this function:

![A Visual Studio Code window with the Debug console open. An object is printed as the result of calling the match path function like it is used by the component.](/assets/04-04-debug-console-01.png)

Now _this_ is a solid confirmation that the `/dashboard` path unexpectedly matches the current URL. Knowing this, I can try fixing the code right in the Debug console!

My hunch is that the path matching is not strict, and I can confirm it by running the same `matchPath()` function again but now with the `end` option set to `true`:

```
matchPath({ path: '/dashboard', end: true }, location.pathname)
```

![A Visual Studio Code window with the Debug console open. Null is printed as the result of calling the match path function with the end option set to true.](/assets/04-04-debug-console-02.png)

Woohoo! The `null` returned from `matchPath()` means that the `/dashboard` path no longer matches the current URL and the corresponding menu item will not be marked as active.

Debug console is an _extremely_ powerful tool at your disposal. All the breakpoint techniques you've learned today can be applied to any JavaScript code, not just to test.
